### Code practices
Please help us follow the best practices to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

 * Single commit per pull request
 * Reference the issue numbers in the commit message. Follow the pattern Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>
 * Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
 * The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherrypicking and merging squashes.
 * If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.

### Join the development

* Before you join the development, please set up the project on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely. Press on any button you can find and see where it leads to. Explore. (Don't worry ... Nothing will happen to the app or to you due to the exploring :wink: You'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the app.)
* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
